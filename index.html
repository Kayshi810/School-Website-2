The students who are on campus still get recess, lunch, and snack time to interact with their friends and even have a chance to make new ones. But the students who are at home don't get any of those. Some students rely on school to make new friends and if students don't get that time to talk to others, they may not EVER have a chance to make friends.  </p>
